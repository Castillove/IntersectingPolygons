Intersecting polygons  
Goal: "Use projective duality to show how to
find the intersection of convex polygons."  
Stretch: "Give an extension to conconvex polygons."

Definitions:
Polygon: A polygonal curve that starts and ends at the same point  
Polygonal curve/ Poly-line:
Sequence of points joined in sequence by straight-line segments  
Simple polygonal curve:
A polygonal curve that does not self-intersect
(no straight-line segements in the polygonal curve intersect)  
Simple polygon: A polygon that doesn't self intersect  
Convexity: Given a set X that is a subset of the R^d,
the set is convex if for all pairs of points there is a
line segement between the points such that the line segment is a subset of X.
Convex closure conv(X)
1) The set of all convex combinations of the points in X
2) The intersection of all convex sets contianing X  
Convex Hull: A sequence of points describing the
boundary of the convex closure  
Convex polygon: A simple polygon whose points lie on the convex hull  
Intersection:
Given n sets, their intersection is the set of points
that are in all of the sets  
Projective duality: y + ax + b = 0 <=> (a, b)
