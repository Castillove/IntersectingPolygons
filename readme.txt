Intersecting polygons
Goal: "Use projective duality to show how to find the intersection of convex polygons."
Stretch: "Give an extension to conconvex polygons."

Definitions:
Polygon: A polygonal curve that starts and ends at the same point
	Polygonal curve/ Poly-line: Sequence of points joined in sequence by straight-line segements
	*Simple polygonal curve: A polygonal curve that does not self-intersect
	*Self-intersect: no straight-line segements in the polygonal curve intersect
	*Simple polygon: A polygon that doesn't self intersect
Convexity: Given a set X that is a subset of the d-dimension, the set is convex if for all pairs of points there is a line segement between the points such that the (points consisting of the) line segment is also in the set X.
	   *Convex combinations
	   *Convex closure conv(X)	1) The set of all convex combinations of the points in X
	   	   	   		2) The intersection of all convex sets contianing X
	   *Convex Hull: A sequence of points describing the boundary of the convex closure
Convex polygons: A simple polygon whose points either lie on the convex hull, or wihtin the convex closure 
Intersection: Given 2 sets X and Y, the intersection of the sets is the set of points that exist in both set X and in set Y
