Intersecting polygons
Goal: "Use projective duality to show how to find the intersection of convex polygons."
Stretch: "Give an extension to conconvex polygons."

Definitions:
Polygon: A polygonal curve that starts and ends at the same point
	Polygonal curve/ Poly-line: Sequence of points joined in sequence by straight-line segments
	Simple polygonal curve: A polygonal curve that does not self-intersect (no straight-line segements in the polygonal curve intersect)
	Simple polygon: A polygon that doesn't self intersect
Convexity: Given a set X that is a subset of the d-dimension, the set is convex if for all pairs of points there is a line segement between the points such that the (points consisting of the) line segment is also in the set X.
	Convex closure conv(X)	1) The set of all convex combinations of the points in X
	   	   		2) The intersection of all convex sets contianing X
	Convex Hull: A sequence of points describing the boundary of the convex closure
Convex polygons: A simple polygon whose points either lie on the convex hull, or within the convex closure 
Intersection: Given 2 sets X and Y, the intersection of the sets is the set of points that exist in both set X and in set Y
Projective duality/ Polarity (In 2-dimensions): Each vertex in a graph is mapped to an edge and each edge is mapped to a vertex
